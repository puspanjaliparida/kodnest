    <h1><i>The Minimalist Web</i>: Crafting Pages with Only the Basics</h1>

    <p>
      In a world where websites are loaded with flashy animations, heavy
      scripts, and high-resolution images, the art of building a pure,
      lightweight webpage is nearly forgotten. This article explores the charm
      and power of HTML’s <mark>simplest tags</mark>.
    </p>

    <h2>The Back-to-Basics Movement</h2>
    <p>
      Back in the early days of the internet, webpages were nothing more than
      plain text, sprinkled with <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> styles. The focus
      was on the <b>content</b>, not the decoration. In many ways, this was the
      <i>golden age</i> of readability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <u>HTML</u> language itself was designed for structure
      <sup>___</sup> headings, paragraphs, and semantic meaning. E = mc<sup
        >2</sup
      >
      still looks good without a single pixel of CSS, and H<sub>2</sub>O remains
      as clear as ever.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Strip It Down?</h2>
    <p>
      There’s a quiet beauty in simplicity. Without distractions, readers focus
      on the words. "Minimalism is not the lack of something, it’s the perfect
      amount of something," as a famous designer once said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Removing images and heavy layouts means faster load times, better
      accessibility, and even nostalgia for the <strike>chaotic</strike>
      <u>simpler</u> internet days.
    </p>

    <h2>Magazine-Style Sections</h2>
    <p>Just like in a printed magazine, articles can be divided with <u>bold headings</u> 
       and subtle separators. Think of hr as the thin line between chapters, and 
       headings as your section titles.</p>
    <p>You can even keep a “side note” feel with smaller text for author comments or additional
       reading hints.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>A Practical Demonstration</h2>
    <p>Imagine we are describing a recipe in this minimal style:</p>
    <p>Step 1: Mix 250g of flour with H<sub>2</sub>O until smooth. Step 2: Heat at 180<sup>°</sup>C for 30 minutes. Step 3:
       <strike>Serve cold</strike><u>Serve warm</u> for best taste.</p>
    <p>Code snippet: <small>temperature = 180; // degrees Celsius</p></small>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Closing Thought</h2>
    <p>Stripping a webpage down to its <b>bare essentials</b> is not just a design choice <sup>___</sup> it’s a statement. It says: "The words matter
       more than the wrapping."</p>
    <p>So the next time you open a code editor, try creating a page with nothing but <i>headings</i>, <i>paragraphs</i>, and <i>text formatting</i>. You 
       might just rediscover the timeless elegance of the early web.</p>
